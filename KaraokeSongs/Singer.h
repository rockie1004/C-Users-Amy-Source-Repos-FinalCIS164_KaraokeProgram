//singer is going to use the artist.h and the song.h
//singer handle/displayname how can we create a string variable to use as the key
//user name = "amy" + the number of amy in the system (ie amy100)
//displayname
//singer history map - amy100 will have a map, key value pairs would be the date (key) and the songkey (value)
//2nd map would be the songkey and datestring (switch)

//these are both multimaps

//kj stuff is a doubly linked list (do we need a struct/class that's called songReq - singer, song, date, y/n (did they complete the song)
//add a new to the beginning/anywhere in the existing list, remove from the list altogether
//something to simulate the queues moving (insert into song histories and remove from the linked list)
//SongRequest.h will house the class and any functions 
//declare the linked list below (as we have for artist.h and song.h
